# [LINFO1104] Concepts, paradigmes et s√©mantique des langages de programmation (Oz - Erlang)

## My Questions

    * What is a Chunk ? How is it different than a Cell or a Record ?
    * How to create a new Chunk ?
    * Are class objects Chunks ? Is that how they are stored in memory ?
        * Is this how they have implemented inheritance ?
    * How are Ports implemented using Chunks and Cells ?
